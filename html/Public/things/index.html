    <p>On the final day in a short introductory Java class at the Dalian University of Technology, the students modified a very simple <tt>Thing</tt> class to give it more interesting behavior.</p>
    <p>The source code and lab are available <a href="final/">here</a>.</p>
    <p>And here is an example, using <a href="Thing.java">this modified <tt>Thing</tt> code</a> and also using <a href="ThingsApplet.java"><tt>ThingsApplet.java</tt></a> to work as an applet as opposed to a Swing application. Click in the gray area and on the <tt>Things</tt> and the button, and stuff will happen:</p>
    <applet code="ThingsApplet.class" width="600" height="430">
    </applet>
